### Our goal is to use deep learning models to upscale/restore low-resolution videos and anime images to high resolution, as well as increase the frame rate of regular 24-frame videos and anime.

### Super-Resolution Model
Super-resolution technology aims to enhance the resolution of images or videos through training deep learning models. By utilizing advanced deep learning models, we can restore low-resolution videos and anime images to high resolution, providing a clearer and more detailed visual experience.

### Frame Interpolation Model
Frame interpolation technology aims to increase the frame rate of videos to improve the smoothness and finesse of animations and movies. Our frame interpolation model can increase the frame rate of regular 24-frame videos and anime to higher rates such as 72, 96, or 120 frames. By generating additional frames, our model creates a smoother animation effect, resulting in a more realistic and enjoyable viewing experience.
